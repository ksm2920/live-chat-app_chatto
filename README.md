## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The npm start script will spawn a webserver on port 3000 which hosts the Phonecat app.
You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: http://localhost:3000

### `npm run cypress`

You should run the Phonecat app up and running.  We are now ready to run Cypress tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
